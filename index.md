### CPSC 120

*Lab 1

Lab 1 part 1 was one of my favorites because the hello world program is somewhat famous.
Its the statement that got my dad into computer science. And learning the
git commands was also a fun bit.

*Lab 2

Lab 2 was also funny because it was a mad libs game.
Inputting the words and seeing what comes out was a fun bit to tinker with.
Although I blank on which part it was specifically.

*Lab 3

Lab 3 was also fun to see the BMI of women and men.
It was the lab I met my friend joseph in so that was fun.
Also when I got the full gist of what pair programming was about.
