### CPSC 120 Projects

* **Lab 1 - Hello World**

Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it was the first time I wrote and ran a real program. I learned how to set up a basic C++ project, how to use `cout` to print to the console, and how to compile and execute code through the terminal. It gave me the confidence to know I could make programs from scratch.

* **Lab 9 - File Input and Output**

Lab 9 helped me understand how to read from and write to files in C++. I learned how to open file streams, check for errors, and process text line by line. It was my first experience working with external data and thinking about how programs interact with the real world.

* **Lab 12 - Animated Gradient**

Lab 12 was awesome because it combined math, color, and animation together. I learned how to use sine functions to create smooth visual transitions and how each pixel can be controlled through programming. Watching the gradient animate was satisfying and made programming feel creative and artistic.
